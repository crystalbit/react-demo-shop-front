# Hi!
This is the Demo Shop frontend.

Here is the repo with instructions, dump and uploads: https://github.com/crystalbit/demo-shop-howto-deploy
Here is a backend part: https://github.com/crystalbit/node-demo-shop-api

Please, visit the first link to read about:
* deploy on localhost
* deploy on server
* testing both backend and frontend

# Some information:
* Frontend is written in React with Material UI using create-react-app and jest for tests.
* Backend is written on Node.JS with express.js framework, passport.js for authorisation, Sequelize ORM for MySQL connection and Mocha+Chai for tests.
* The project uses a MySQL database.
* It is ready for using with nginx in production.
* And can be easily run on localhost without nginx with a full functionality.

Project is deployed here: http://5.101.116.39/
